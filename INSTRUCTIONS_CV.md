Final Project Instructions — Computer Vision

Overview

For your final project, you will create a Passion Project — an end-to-end application that you design around a topic that you care deeply about.
You have complete freedom in choosing your project theme or problem space. However, your project must incorporate at least one major concept, technique, or tool that we covered during the course.

You may use tools such as Bolt.new, Trae, Windsurf, Cursor, or any comparable no-code/low-code platforms, coding environments, or deployment solutions to build and deploy your app.

This project is your opportunity to showcase your skills, creativity, and passion in Computer Vision and application development.

Requirements
✅ Application Topic: Your choice, based on your passion or interest.

✅ Course Connection: Integrate at least one concept from class (e.g., image classification, object detection, segmentation, facial recognition, feature extraction, etc.).

✅ End-to-End Workflow:

Working deployment — your app must be live and publicly accessible via a URL.
✅ Deployment: Deploy your application using any cloud platform or deployment tool (examples: Vercel, Render, Hugging Face Spaces, Bolt.new, Windsurf, etc.).
