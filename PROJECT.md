Please review the INSTRUCTIONS_NLP and INSTRUCTIONS_CV.md file in the root folder. I need to create an application and be able to deploy it online, possibly also using GitHub for version control and venv environment with requirements.txt and gitignore. The application will be able to transcribe a youtube video in whichever language and create a similar video script in Spanish. The Spanish script is not necessarily a direct translation, but an interpretration with simimal context. The application will also use Computer Vision technology to extract scene description and create prompts to feed AI image and video generators in order to create similar scenes. This project combines both NLP and CV. The script will follow the following structure:

A video script for a YouTube channel typically balances structure with personality, tailored to the channel's niche and audience. Here's what it usually consists of:

🔹 1. Hook (0–15 seconds)
Purpose: Grab attention immediately.

Content: Pose a question, tease the main value, show a quick result, or deliver a bold statement.

Example: “What if I told you you’ve been brushing your teeth wrong your whole life?”

🔹 2. Intro / Branding (15–30 seconds)
Purpose: Briefly introduce the creator or the channel and set expectations.

Content: Channel name, value proposition, quick logo animation or catchphrase.

Example: “Welcome to TechBite, where we break down tech in bite-sized chunks.”

🔹 3. Main Content (Bulk of the video)
Purpose: Deliver on the hook and give value.

Content: Organized into clear sections or points, often with visual or spoken transitions.

Use bullet-point outlines for talking points.

Insert visual cues (B-roll, graphics, on-screen text).

Add calls to action in between (e.g., “Don’t forget to like and subscribe”).

🔹 4. Call to Action (CTA)
Purpose: Tell viewers what to do next.

Content: Ask for a like, subscribe, comment, or direct them to another video or external site.

Example: “If this helped you, hit that like button and check out our playlist on DIY fixes.”

🔹 5. Outro (Optional)
Purpose: Wrap up cleanly and reinforce engagement.

Content: Channel jingle, end screen placeholders, thank you message.

Example: “Thanks for watching! Catch you in the next one!”

💡 Tips:
Keep language conversational.
Include camera directions or on-screen graphics if you’re editing or directing.
Time your script roughly—1 minute of speaking = ~125–150 words.
