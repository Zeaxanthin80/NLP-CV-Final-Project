NLP Final Project Assignment: Passion Project

Overview

For your final project in this course, you will create a Passion Project that applies at least one Natural Language Processing (NLP) model we covered during the semester. This project is an opportunity for you to explore a topic that genuinely interests you while demonstrating your mastery of key NLP concepts and technologies.

You are encouraged to leverage tools such as Bolt.new, Cursor, or Windsurf to streamline your development process. The final deliverable should showcase your creativity, technical skill, and understanding of how to implement NLP models in real-world or innovative contexts.

Project Requirements
Select a passion area (e.g., music, gaming, education, fitness, mental health, sports, social justice, etc.)

Implement at least one NLP model discussed in class (e.g., BERT, GPT, T5, Llama, NLTK models, SpaCy models, etc.)

Develop a prototype or proof-of-concept that applies your chosen model in a meaningful way.

Prepare a short project report (1-2 pages) summarizing:

Problem you aimed to solve
Tools and model(s) used
How the model was integrated
Key challenges and how you addressed them
Future improvements you would make
